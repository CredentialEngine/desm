        description: Data Ecosystem Schema Mapper Tool supports pairwise, semantic mapping of schema terms and their definitions using a synthetic spine agnostic to data models and formats. Resultant mappings are intended to help data standards organizations, developers, decision makers, and others have a clear understanding of how schemas map and provide useful visual and data outputs of completed mappings.
