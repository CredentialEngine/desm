  # This instructs RSpec to use database_cleaner to "truncate" the database before every test suite, it empties every
  # table entirely. This is a brute-force approach to database cleaning but for personal projects, it will serve just
  # fine.
  # Using Active Record, the except statement is essential. Without it, the database_cleaner will destroy Active
  # Record's environment data, resulting in a NoEnvironmentInSchemaError every time your tests run.

  # On a test-by-test basis (i.e. before(:each), not before(:suite)) , truncation is overkill.
  # Here, we set the database_cleaner strategy to transaction, which means every test will create a database
  # transaction that will simply be rolled back when it ends, as if it never happened.

  # DatabaseCleaner.start and DatabaseCleaner.end are simply the triggers to start the cleaning process before and
