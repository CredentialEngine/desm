The files in this folder define the terms used in DESM mappings, that is the mapping predicates we recommend using and the properties and classes used for machine readable output in JSON-LD / RDF.

The [source file for the DESM Mapping Domain model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sIPAXEMdIkarQhk4UkNyXF7UAJtZS4WG/view?usp=drive_link) is in Google Drive (limited access).

If you need to change the mapping predicates, or use other predicates for a project please be sure to use different IRIs to identify the predicates you create.
