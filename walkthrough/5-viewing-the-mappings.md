## Domain tabs

At the top, a tabs bar can be seen. It contain a single tab per each domain available in the tool (see [here](https://github.com/t3-innovation-network/desm/tree/master/walkthrough/2-uploading-a-file.md#the-available-domains)). Switching between tabs, will change the list below to reflect the information about the proper spine properties.

## Filters

![Sort options](https://res.cloudinary.com/ricardo-gamarra/image/upload/v1609287896/t3-desm/sortoptions_bstjtq.gif)

The information can be filtered and ordered by different criteria

- There's a search bar, to filter the spine properties
- There are also options to sort both the spine and the alignments
- The user can hide the spine rows without results (taking the filter values)
- The information can be filtered by organization, and predicate values

## Spine and alignment cards

The information the user worked with in the edit term and during all the mapping process, is displayed in the cards.

## And that's it!
