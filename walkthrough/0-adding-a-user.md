An administrator will have access to the dashboard by singing. A default administrator user is provided with email `admin@desmsolutions.org` and the password specified in the `.env` file. Remember that a user can always reset the password using the reset password functionality. You can see [How to reset password](https://github.com/t3-innovation-network/desm/tree/master/walkthrough/1-welcome-to-the-tool.md) for instructions.

## Access to the "Add User" screen

As can be seen in the image above, once the administrator is logged in, a dashboard button is shown in the top navigation bar at the right top corner.

A click on this button will lead the user to the main dashboard screen, where a left side menu offers a "Users" link. It shows the user a list of all the existent users in the tool.

A button at the top of the users list, says "Add User". Clicking on it, will reveal the "Create User" form. Options are:

- fullname
- email
- Organization
- Role

All are required fields. The organization is a list of all the available organizations (which can be created by an administrator using the dashboard as well). The available roles are only 2: `Administrator` and `Regular User`. 

## And that's it!

After pressing "Create", the user will receive a "Welcome" email with instructions to access the tool.
